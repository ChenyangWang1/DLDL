# DLDL-MatConvNet

This repository is a MatConvNet re-implementation of ["Deep Label Distribution Learning with Label Ambiguity", Bin-Bin Gao, Chao Xing, Chen-Wei Xie, Jianxin Wu, Xin Geng](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2689998). The paper is accepted at [IEEE Trans. Image Processing (TIP), 2017].

You can train Deep ConvNets from Scratch or fine-tune pre-trained model on your datasets with limited samples and ambiguous labels. This repo is created by [Bin-Bin Gao](http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/gaobb).
